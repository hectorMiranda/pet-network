# The Pet Network App

This application was created as a code challenge given by Ayzenberg, this is a pet management app in Rails. 

The app allows pet owners to add their pets and allow others to view them and comment on their profiles.

This app uses:

* Bootstrap for styling
* Devise for user creationg and authentication
* will_paginate to support pets pagination
* Heroku: http://pet-network.herokuapp.com/
* Github as repo provider: https://github.com/hectorMiranda/pet-network

The app still needs some work on the styles, comments and search and proper testing. I may be updating this repo soon to add improvements but at the moment I ran out of time.
